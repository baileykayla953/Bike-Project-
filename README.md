# Bike Buying Target Audience Data Analysis 

### Purpose: Through data analysis, I used this bike buying data to find patterns of buying behaviors for bikes with martial status, gender, income range, number of children, Education level, Occupation, Homeowner/Renter, Cars 1-4, Commute Distance, and Region. Through this analysis this will help develop business strategy and marketing efforts for our target audience 

### Raw Data Overview
Create Filters for Data Review to begin analysis process

  ### Clean Data 
1.Remove any duplicates
2.Change any labels that could cause confusion on a dashboard M/S & F/M ( we had 2 mâ€™s that represented different things within the data) ctrl H to change columns 
3.Check formatting and data type for each column. 
4.Create age brackets using IF statements and Nested IF statements to create adolescent, middle aged, and old brackets.

I created Pivot Tables to deep dive into the data and reveal patterns for the following:
