# Bike Buying Target Audience Data Analysis 

### Purpose: Through data analysis, I used this bike buying data to find patterns of buying behaviors for bikes with martial status, gender, income range, number of children, Education level, Occupation, Homeowner/Renter, Cars 1-4, Commute Distance, and Region. Through this analysis this will help develop business strategy and marketing efforts for our target audience

3.Check formatting and data type for each column. 
4.Create age brackets using IF statements and Nested IF statements to create adolescent, middle aged, and old brackets.
